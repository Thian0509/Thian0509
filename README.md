## About Me

I'm a third-year Bachelor of Computing student, specializing in Software Engineering. I enjoy designing scalable systems, solving real-world problems through clean code, and continuously learning new technologies â€” especially in backend development and machine learning.

I believe in writing code thatâ€™s maintainable, modular, and well-documented. Whether Iâ€™m working solo or in a team, I aim to build with both structure and purpose.
